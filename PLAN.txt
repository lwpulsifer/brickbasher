Breakout Variants:
    I thought Warlords (multiplayer, protect your own castle) was an interesting twist on the classic Breakout game.
    From a gamer perspective, it adds a very different dimension to hitting the ball because you have to pay attention
    not only to where you want the ball to go but also to what angles it gives your opponent. From a design perspective,
    it adds some layers of logic to how you want the paddle to work (should it be able to work "backwards" i.e. after
    bouncing off of your castle?)

    With this in mind I'd like to design a Breakout game with a single-player and a two-player mode - first, the simple
    traditional breakout game with one paddle, one ball (most of the time), and the objective to break all of the blocks
    in increasingly more difficult configurations without letting the ball by your paddle, and second, a two-player
    version where two paddles each guard a fortress of blocks, with the goal to destroy your opponent's fortress before
    s/he destroys yours.

Single-Player Levels:
    Level 1: This will be a basic square array of blocks, with one line of gaps between each line of blocks, like so.

        [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]

        [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]

        [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]

        ... etc

    Level 2 - "Blockade": There will be a line of impenetrable blocks at the bottom of the block array, with a small gap
    through which the ball can pass to hit the other blocks behind it.

                            [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]
                            [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]
                            [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]
                            [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]

    Impenetrable-->  [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]      GAP     ^Wall

    Level 3 - "Moving Blocks": In this level, the blocks will move back and forth across the screen, increasing the
    difficulty of hitting them and reacting to the ball bouncing off of them. The configuration will be like the first
    level but with spaces between them to allow the blocks to move back and forth. The blocks will bounce off of one
    another when they hit each other.

    (If Feasible) Level 4 - "Teleporting Blocks": The blocks in this level will be arranged in a checkerboard style pattern, with a
    block, then a gap, then a block, etc. Some blocks in this level will teleport to a random open space in the game screen
    upon the first hit, then break on the second. This will be difficult to anticipate, especially if they teleport
    near to the paddle.
    
    (If Feasible) Level 5 - "Tower": The blocks will be arranged in concentric "rings" (really more like squares due to the shape of 
    the blocks). In the middle will be a group of explosive blocks, which if hit will detonate and destroy all of the
    blocks in a chain reaction. After beating this level, the player will be taken to the "You won!" game screen.

    Multiplayer mode will be configured as follows - the blocks used will be random combinations of all the block types

               -----------------    Wall     --------------------------------

                        [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]
                        [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]
                        [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]
                        [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]

                    Paddle moves along this line to protect the blocks





                    Paddle2 moves along this line to protect the blocks

                        [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]
                        [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]
                        [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]
                        [BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK][BLOCK]

               ---------------     Wall   ---------------------------------------

Block Types:

    Impenetrable blocks: Won't ever break, no matter how many times hit
    Moving blocks: Will move back and forth across the screen, changing direction when they hit the wall or another block
    Teleporting blocks: When hit the first time teleport to a random open (i.e. no block, no paddle) location on the
      screen. On the second hit, they'll break.
    Explosive blocks: Break all blocks directly adjacent to them when hit.
    Multi-hit blocks: Will "crack" when hit but won't break until a certain number >1 of hits.

Powerups: Will drop from random blocks when those blocks are hit.

    Extra Life: Adds one to number of lives
    Wide Paddle: Doubles paddle width
    Slow Ball: Slows the ball down for a certain time period to make it easier to anticipate
    Explosive Ball: Makes the ball into a kind of missile which explodes when the player presses the space bar and
        destroys all nearby blocks. The ball then returns to the paddle and can be reshot
    Lose Life: A negative powerup to keep the player on his/her toes.


Extra Addition:

    The multiplayer mode will be the significant "extra" part of my breakout game. It will significantly increase the
    complexity and repeatability of gameplay by allowing for competition with another player. It will also be a
    significant addition in terms of code because I'll need to account for the randomization of block types in this format
    and the logic of how the ball should not bounce off of a paddle when it's coming from behind that paddle. I also want
    to implement a feature where the player can use the explosive ball and block powerups to attack the other player's
    paddle, taking away their lives or breaking off pieces of their paddle until it's tiny and useless.
